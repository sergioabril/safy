# safy
Wrapper for CryptoSwift; Encrypt/Decrypt text/images with a password on your iPhone/Mac.
Also, generates QR codes (on iOS) with the resulting cipher (for text encrypted data), and allows decryption of them too.

# Disclosure
for now, It's intended only for personal use, and I can not guarantee the safety of the implemented encryption process

# Install
The wrapper itself is located on safymac/CryptoHelper.swift , and itâ€™s shared among Mac/iOS apps. It has all the functions, key-generation processes, etc.

# License
To sum up, you can download, test and edit; but you can not distribute for commercial use. Either way, you should keep my name at the top of every code file
